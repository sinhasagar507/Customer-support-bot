    "Previously, my focus in the notebooks was on obtaining labeled data for my chatbot. However, this current notebook is centered around utilizing PyTorch for the classification of intents within fresh, unseen user-generated data. The model has transitioned to a supervised learning approach, leveraging the labels derived from the unsupervised learning conducted in the preceding notebook."
